## Dev's (me) comments (also me)

After finishing the course, there are still some leftover stuff to do, mainly for portfolio but also to encrave them in my mind. They are:
- Adding the final 5 Damage Abilities (1 for Fire, 2 for Lightning and 2 for Arcane) âœ…
- Adding ACTUAL behavior for the 3 Passive Abilities  âœ…
- Adding a Game Over screen and maybe some interesting stuff with it? âœ…
- Having at least 3 playable levels, with maybe more mobs 
- Add more playable Characters, this should be easy-ish (I can only imagine the trouble it'll be with saves)
- If adding multiplayer, have a wave system so it gets waaay more interesting to play together, although I'm pretty sure I'll be long gone by then
- Localization and Settings âœ…

## Final Thoughts:
This course has built actually a quite robust system with GAS and with a Save System on top of it, not to mention the replicated stuff which is always good to see, even if they aren't to be used.
I kinda want to move on to other projects, but at the point it was over, I was left with a skeleton of a product, thus not suitable to be publicly shared, yet.
